class BaseModel(models.Model):
    """
    Abstract base model inherited by every model in QCSTS.

    Provides:
        id          — UUID primary key (not sequential integer)
        created_at  — when the record was created (server time, auto)
        updated_at  — when the record was last modified (server time, auto)
        created_by  — which user created this record
        is_active   — soft delete flag (False = deleted, record preserved)

    Why UUID instead of integer ID?
        Sequential IDs (1, 2, 3...) expose information:
        - How many records exist
        - Allows enumeration attacks (/api/batches/1, /api/batches/2...)
        UUIDs are random and reveal nothing.

    Why is_active instead of DELETE?
        GxP compliance requires all records to be preserved forever.
        Hard deleting a batch or test result is a compliance violation.
        We set is_active=False and filter it out in queries.
